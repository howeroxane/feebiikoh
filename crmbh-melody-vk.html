Rather than naming a song, this is more about looking for a song. A few years ago, there was a music I loved but I don't remember much about it now. Rather, I don't even remember the melody, but I do have some oddly specific info. 1. It was a piano music (maybe some drums and stuff, but the piano was the main part) 2. The YouTube video for the song only had a static image of a beach and a very blue sky and sea. 3. It began in C major and there. Тут вы можете просмотреть мои рисунки с Ивтобера 2018 года.

The sheet music was fairly easy to find on the Internet. 3. I think the composer's name was something like Steve Zaragua. Volpina Ledi-Bag Melody (by Zagtoon) Posts by community Search.

Can someone tell me what this song is, if it even exists?: https://vocaroo.com/i/s0ulJb0srVks (https://vocaroo.com/i/s0ulJb0srVks) I thought of this melody while I was in the shower. I want to use it in a future song, but I think it might already be a jazz standard. I took jazz guitar lessons in high school (2012-2016), so maybe that time frame will help you solve this. I especially remember the first part of the melody that I played on my guitar in the Vocaroo link. Thanks.

From what I can remember; there's this driving drumgroove where the bassdrum is on 1 and 3 and the snare is on 2 and 4, and there's a melody on top of that with the same microtonal scale that is presented in the YouTube video.
